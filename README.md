The following is a Scientific Graphical User Interface Calculator 
that was created using C++ and the GUI Application Framework 
widely known as Qt. The aim of this project was to design a 
calculator with numerous functionalities and operations to 
solve and compute different types of mathematical expressions.
This application accomplishes that by using various 
widgets (miniature application views) within a parent 
widget to display a very organized calculator UI and by 
making calls to callback functions based on user actions
using QT's SLOT and SIGNALS functions.
